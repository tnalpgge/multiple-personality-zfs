* FreeBSD Installer materials

In order to make this setup work when installing from non-customized FreeBSD media, you must partition disks in the shell, create filesystems, and mount them in an expected location (~/mnt~).  The scripts in this directory should be run in the implied numerical order.  

You must also leave some files behind for the installer to copy into place in the live system.  Files in subdirectories of this one must be placed in subdirectories of ~/tmp~ as the installer expects.
