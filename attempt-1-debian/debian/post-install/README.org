* Debian Post-Install Customization

Files in subdirectories of this one should be copied into the indicated locations, relative to the root of your live file system.

Scripts in this directory perform modifications to the system.  You must run the scripts with super-user permissions.  (Consider installing the *doas* or *sudo* packages.)  Scripts with lower-numbered numerical prefixes (i.e. closer to 00) may be run before files are copied.  Scripts with higher-number numerical prefixes (i.e. closer to 99) must be run after files are copied.
